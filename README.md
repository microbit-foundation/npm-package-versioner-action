Manages the `package.json` version field for GitHub action.

The action will write the new version number to package.json.

Usage:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: microbit-foundation/npm-package-versioner-action@v1
```

## Development

1. :hammer_and_wrench: Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. Format, test, and build the action

   ```bash
   npm run all
   ```

   > This step is important! It will run [`ncc`](https://github.com/vercel/ncc)
   > to build the final JavaScript action code with all dependencies included.
   > If you do not run this step, your action will not work correctly when it is
   > used in a workflow. This step also includes the `--license` option for
   > `ncc`, which will create a license file for all of the production node
   > modules used in your project.

This generates files that must be committed.
